## Reflection

# What patterns or surprises did you notice?
I noticed that most functions follow a very similar pattern. Also the isEven function could replace the isOdd function but just negating it like !isEven(x).

# What logic challenged your thinking?
I struggled with the % (Modulo/Remainder) operator at first. Once I wrapped my head around it, it made sense on how its used in the even/odd functions.

# How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?
Its nice to have a toolkit of frequently used functions so that you don't have to reinvint the wheel every time you need them. It saves time and reduces duplicate code.
